# Fishtank-Simulator

> This is a simulator to show fish life inside a fishtank, where you can feed them and clean.

## Fishes

> The fishes have a herd algorithm that makes them behave with realistic movements, they check the distance from other fishes and from the fishtank glass.
> Also, in this algorithm we implemented the food finding.
> The fishes have three important stats: HP, XP and Age.
> - HP: goes down over time taking into account it's age and, if it is activated, the dirt from the fishtank. It can be restored through feeding, if not, the fish will die.
> - XP: it's incremented once you feed the fish, when it reaches the maximun, the fish can have a child if it finds a couple.
> - Age: increases over time, the fish will grow according to it.

## Food

> We have a food jar that we can use to feed the fishes, when it's activated, the camera will change to the top view. It has a limit of total food.

## Cleaning

> It it's activated, the dirt of the fishtank will increase over time and it can be cleaned with the sponge button.

## Stats

> - Death Fishes
> - Oldest Age
